 <h4>Future of Gym Industry in India</h4>          
 <p class="text-muted">Indians are becoming more fitness enthusiasts and have begun to keep track of their everyday activities and way of life. Traditional practices and exercises are being strengthened and augmented by a modern, dynamic, and developing fitness sector in India as a result of globalization and the ease with which knowledge is available.
The government is also creating awareness among individuals to have a healthier life by participating in physical activities through statewide initiatives such as the Fit India Movement. Its goal is to alter people's habits from a passive to a physically active lifestyle.</p>
